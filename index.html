                    <h3>Dubai</h3>
                    <p>Dubai is mostly used as a stopover destination for travelers flying in and out on Emirates.
                            While Dubai can easily be a stopover city where you hit the big sites in a couple of days, there’s 
                            a surprising amount of things to do here for those looking to spend more time.
                            I loved my time in Dubai more than I thought I would! It’s a city 
                            trapped between the old and the new.</p>

                    <h3>Berlin</h3>
                            <p>Berlin is Germany’s capital and the largest city in the country.
                            Berlin has become very popular with students and young artists, writers, and creatives who have become the city’s new immigrants.
                            While I dislike the “industrial” look of the city, the art, history, and nightlife cannot be beat. 
                            Berlin is an old city with a young heart and one of the most fun, coolest, diverse. and eclectic cities in Europe.
                            There’s a constant sense of motion here.</p>
